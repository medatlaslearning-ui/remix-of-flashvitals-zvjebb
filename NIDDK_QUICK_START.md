2. **Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD)**
3. **Kidney Stones (Nephrolithiasis)**
4. **Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD)**
5. **Glomerular Diseases**
6. **Hemodialysis**

## How to Use

### Quick Queries

```

### Treatment-Specific Queries
Ask about specific treatments:

```
"SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetic kidney disease"

"ACE inhibitors for CKD"
"Vascular access for hemodialysis"
```

## Key Features

### Strong Recommendations
High-confidence recommendations based on solid evidence:
- Screening high-risk patients for CKD
- Blood pressure control targets
- ACE inhibitors/ARBs for albuminuria
- SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetic kidney disease
- Fluid intake for kidney stone prevention
- AV fistula for hemodialysis

### Conditional Recommendations
Lower-confidence recommendations where evidence is less certain:
- Dietary protein restriction in CKD
- Tolvaptan for high-risk PKD patients
- Medical expulsive therapy for kidney stones
- Immunosuppressive therapy for glomerular diseases
- Home hemodialysis options

### Clinical Implementation
Detailed step-by-step guidance for:
- Screening and diagnosis
- Staging and risk stratification
- Treatment initiation and titration
- Monitoring and follow-up
- Complication management
- Referral criteria

## Example Responses

### Query: "NIDDK guideline for chronic kidney disease"

**Response includes**:
- Guideline summary
- Strong recommendations (screening, BP control, RAAS blockade)
- Conditional recommendations (dietary modifications, SGLT2 inhibitors)
- Clinical implementation (screening, staging, treatment, monitoring)
- Key points (high-yield summary)
- Quality of evidence

### Query: "How to prevent kidney stones"

**Response includes**:
- Fluid intake recommendations (>2.5 L/day urine output)
- Dietary modifications (sodium restriction, normal calcium intake)
- Medical therapy (thiazides, potassium citrate, allopurinol)
- Metabolic evaluation for recurrent stones
- Stone composition-specific management

## Integration with Other Guidelines

### NIDDK + KDIGO
Both guidelines may appear for renal queries:
- **KDIGO**: International perspective, graded recommendations
- **NIDDK**: U.S. government perspective, patient education focus
- **Together**: Comprehensive renal disease coverage

### NIDDK + Merck Manual
Complementary information:
- **Merck Manual**: Detailed pathophysiology and clinical presentation
- **NIDDK**: Evidence-based guidelines and patient education
- **Together**: Complete understanding of kidney diseases

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific
✅ "NIDDK guideline for diabetic kidney disease"
❌ "kidney disease"

### Use Keywords
✅ "SGLT2 inhibitors for diabetic nephropathy"
✅ "Tolvaptan for ADPKD"
✅ "Thiazide diuretics for hypercalciuria"

### Ask About Specific Aspects
✅ "How to screen for diabetic kidney disease"
✅ "Blood pressure targets in CKD"
✅ "Dietary modifications for kidney stones"

## Common Questions

### Q: When should I use NIDDK vs KDIGO guidelines?
**A**: Both are excellent resources. NIDDK provides U.S. government perspective with strong patient education focus. KDIGO provides international perspective with detailed evidence grading. Use both for comprehensive understanding.

### Q: Are NIDDK guidelines evidence-based?
**A**: Yes! NIDDK guidelines are based on high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials and large observational studies. Each recommendation includes quality of evidence rating.

### Q: Can I get both NIDDK and Merck Manual information?
**A**: Yes! The chatbot will provide both when relevant. Merck Manual gives detailed pathophysiology, while NIDDK provides evidence-based management guidelines.

### Q: How current are the NIDDK guidelines?
**A**: The guidelines in this system are based on 2023 NIDDK recommendations. Each guideline includes publication year for reference.

## Quick Reference

### CKD Management
- Screen high-risk patients (diabetes, hypertension, family history)
- Stage by eGFR and albuminuria
- Target BP <130/80 mmHg
- ACE inhibitors/ARBs for albuminuria
- SGLT2 inhibitors for CKD with diabetes
- Refer to nephrology when eGFR <30

### Diabetic Kidney Disease
- Screen annually for albuminuria and eGFR
- Target HbA1c <7%
- Target BP <130/80 mmHg
- ACE inhibitors/ARBs for albuminuria
- SGLT2 inhibitors first-line
- GLP-1 agonists if HbA1c not at target

### Kidney Stones
- Increase fluid intake (>2.5 L/day urine output)
- Limit sodium <2 g/day
- Normal calcium intake (1000-1200 mg/day)
- Metabolic evaluation for recurrent stones
- Thiazides for hypercalciuria
- Potassium citrate for hypocitraturia

### Polycystic Kidney Disease
- Diagnose with ultrasound or genetic testing
- Target BP <110/75 mmHg in young patients
- Tolvaptan for high-risk patients
- Manage complications (pain, infections, stones)
- Genetic counseling and family screening

### Glomerular Diseases
- Kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis
- ACE inhibitors/ARBs for proteinuria
- Target BP <130/80 mmHg
- Immunosuppressive therapy for specific diseases
- Manage complications (edema, hyperlipidemia, thrombosis)

### Hemodialysis
- Place AV fistula when eGFR <20
- Adequate dialysis dose (Kt/V ≥1.2)
- Fluid restriction (<5% dry weight gain)
- Dietary restrictions (potassium, phosphorus)
- Phosphate binders with meals
- ESAs for anemia (target Hb 10-11.5 g/dL)
