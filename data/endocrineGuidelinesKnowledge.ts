    guidelineSummary: 'The Endocrine Society guideline for hypothyroidism in adults provides evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of primary hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is defined as elevated TSH with low or low-normal free T4. The guideline emphasizes levothyroxine as the treatment of choice, with dosing based on weight (1.6 mcg/kg/day for overt hypothyroidism). TSH is the primary monitoring parameter with target range 0.5-2.5 mIU/L for most patients. Subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSH with normal free T4) requires individualized treatment decisions based on TSH level, symptoms, and patient factors. The guideline addresses special populations including pregnancy, elderly, and patients with cardiac disease.',
    strongRecommendations: [
      'We recommend levothyroxine monotherapy as the treatment of choice for hypothyroidism (Strong recommendation, High quality evidence)',
      'We recommend measuring serum TSH as the initial test for suspected hypothyroidism (Strong recommendation, High quality evidence)',
      'We recommend starting levothyroxine at full replacement dose (1.6 mcg/kg/day) in young, healthy adults with overt hypothyroidism (Strong recommendation, Moderate quality evidence)',
      'We recommend starting levothyroxine at low dose (25-50 mcg/day) and titrating gradually in elderly patients or those with cardiac disease (Strong recommendation, Moderate quality evidence)',
      'We recommend monitoring TSH 4-8 weeks after initiating levothyroxine or changing dose (Strong recommendation, Moderate quality evidence)',
      'We recommend target TSH of 0.5-2.5 mIU/L for most adults on levothyroxine therapy (Strong recommendation, Low quality evidence)',
      'We recommend treating pregnant women with overt hypothyroidism immediately with levothyroxine (Strong recommendation, High quality evidence)',
      'We recommend increasing levothyroxine dose by 25-30% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed in women with pre-existing hypothyroidism (Strong recommendation, High quality evidence)',
    ],
    weakRecommendations: [
      'We suggest treating subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH 4.5-10 mIU/L with normal free T4) in patients with symptoms, positive TPO antibodies, or goiter (Weak recommendation, Low quality evidence)',
      'We suggest against routine treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH <10 mIU/L in asymptomatic patients without other indications (Weak recommendation, Low quality evidence)',
      'We suggest treating subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH >10 mIU/L even in asymptomatic patients due to increased risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism (Weak recommendation, Moderate quality evidence)',
      'We suggest taking levothyroxine on empty stomach, 30-60 minutes before breakfast, for optimal absorption (Weak recommendation, Low quality evidence)',
      'We suggest separating levothyroxine from calcium, iron, proton pump inhibitors, and other medications that interfere with absorption by at least 4 hours (Weak recommendation, Low quality evidence)',

    qualityOfEvidence: 'Multiple levels: Strong recommendations are based on High to Moderate quality evidence from randomized controlled trials and observational studies; Weak recommendations are based on Moderate to Low quality evidence',
    clinicalImplementation: 'Implementation of Endocrine Society hypothyroidism guidelines requires systematic approach to diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. DIAGNOSIS: Clinical presentation: Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, hair loss, bradycardia, delayed deep tendon reflexes. Laboratory diagnosis: TSH is initial test. If TSH elevated, measure free T4 to confirm diagnosis. Overt hypothyroidism: TSH >10 mIU/L with low free T4 (<0.8 ng/dL). Subclinical hypothyroidism: TSH 4.5-10 mIU/L with normal free T4 (0.8-1.8 ng/dL). Etiology: Primary hypothyroidism (thyroid gland failure): Hashimoto thyroiditis (autoimmune - most common cause), Iatrogenic (post-thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine, external radiation), Medications (lithium, amiodarone, interferon-alpha, tyrosine kinase inhibitors), Iodine deficiency (rare in US). Secondary hypothyroidism (pituitary/hypothalamic failure): Low or inappropriately normal TSH with low free T4. Requires pituitary imaging and evaluation for other pituitary hormone deficiencies. Autoantibodies: Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies: Present in 90% of Hashimoto thyroiditis. Positive TPO antibodies predict progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism. Thyroglobulin antibodies: Less specific than TPO antibodies. TREATMENT: Levothyroxine (T4): Synthetic thyroid hormone, converted to active T3 in peripheral tissues. Preferred formulation: Levothyroxine sodium tablets. Generic and brand name products are bioequivalent. Dosing: Full replacement dose for overt hypothyroidism: 1.6 mcg/kg/day (ideal body weight). Example: 70 kg patient requires ~112 mcg daily (round to 100 or 125 mcg). Lower starting dose for elderly or cardiac disease: 25-50 mcg daily, increase by 12.5-25 mcg every 4-6 weeks. Timing: Take on empty stomach, 30-60 minutes before breakfast. Consistent timing improves absorption and reduces variability. Absorption: Reduced by calcium, iron, aluminum hydroxide, proton pump inhibitors, sucralfate, bile acid sequestrants, soy, fiber. Separate levothyroxine from these by at least 4 hours. Increased requirements: Pregnancy (increase dose by 25-30% as soon as pregnancy confirmed), Malabsorption (celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, gastric bypass), Medications (estrogen, raloxifene, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, sertraline). Decreased requirements: Aging (reduce dose by 20% in elderly), Weight loss. MONITORING: TSH monitoring: Check TSH 4-8 weeks after initiating therapy or changing dose. Once stable, check TSH every 6-12 months. Target TSH: 0.5-2.5 mIU/L for most adults. Higher target (2.5-4.5 mIU/L) acceptable in elderly to avoid overtreatment. Lower target (0.1-0.5 mIU/L) for TSH-suppression therapy in thyroid cancer. Free T4: Not routinely needed if TSH in target range. Measure if TSH discordant with clinical status or suspected central hypothyroidism. Dose adjustments: If TSH >2.5 mIU/L: Increase levothyroxine by 12.5-25 mcg daily. If TSH <0.5 mIU/L: Decrease levothyroxine by 12.5-25 mcg daily. Recheck TSH 4-8 weeks after dose change. SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM: Definition: TSH 4.5-10 mIU/L with normal free T4. Prevalence: 4-10% of general population, higher in women and elderly. Natural history: 2-5% per year progress to overt hypothyroidism. Risk factors for progression: TSH >10 mIU/L, Positive TPO antibodies, Symptoms of hypothyroidism. Treatment indications: TSH >10 mIU/L (even if asymptomatic), TSH 4.5-10 mIU/L with symptoms, positive TPO antibodies, or goiter, Pregnancy or planning pregnancy, Infertility, Hyperlipidemia. Treatment approach: Start levothyroxine 25-50 mcg daily. Target TSH 0.5-2.5 mIU/L. Reassess symptoms and TSH after 3-6 months. If no improvement, consider discontinuing therapy. Observation (no treatment): TSH <10 mIU/L, asymptomatic, negative TPO antibodies. Recheck TSH every 6-12 months. SPECIAL POPULATIONS: Pregnancy: Hypothyroidism increases risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, preeclampsia, impaired fetal neurodevelopment. Screen women with risk factors (personal or family history of thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, prior head/neck radiation, morbid obesity, infertility, prior miscarriage). Treat overt hypothyroidism immediately. Treat subclinical hypothyroidism if TSH >2.5 mIU/L (pregnancy-specific cutoff). Increase levothyroxine dose by 25-30% as soon as pregnancy confirmed. Target TSH: First trimester <2.5 mIU/L, Second/third trimester <3.0 mIU/L. Monitor TSH every 4 weeks in first half of pregnancy, then every 6-8 weeks. Postpartum: Reduce levothyroxine to pre-pregnancy dose. Recheck TSH 6 weeks postpartum. Elderly: Start low dose (25-50 mcg daily) to avoid cardiac complications. Target TSH 2.5-4.5 mIU/L (higher than younger adults). Monitor for atrial fibrillation, angina, heart failure exacerbation. Cardiac disease: Start low dose (25 mcg daily), increase slowly (12.5-25 mcg every 4-6 weeks). Monitor for angina, arrhythmias. Consider cardiology consultation if unstable cardiac disease. Myxedema coma: Rare, life-threatening complication of severe hypothyroidism. Presents with hypothermia, altered mental status, hypoventilation, hypotension, bradycardia. Treatment: ICU admission, IV levothyroxine 200-400 mcg loading dose, then 50-100 mcg daily, IV hydrocortisone 100 mg every 8 hours (until adrenal insufficiency excluded), Supportive care (warming, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors). COMBINATION T4/T3 THERAPY: Not recommended for routine use. Levothyroxine monotherapy is standard of care. Rationale for combination therapy: Some patients report persistent symptoms (fatigue, weight gain, cognitive dysfunction) despite normal TSH on levothyroxine. Hypothesis: Impaired T4 to T3 conversion in some individuals. Evidence: Multiple RCTs show no consistent benefit of combination T4/T3 over T4 monotherapy. Meta-analyses show no improvement in quality of life, mood, or cognition. Potential harms: Increased risk of hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, bone loss. Difficult to maintain stable T3 levels (short half-life). Trial of combination therapy: Consider only in select patients with persistent symptoms despite adequate T4 replacement and normal TSH. Exclude other causes of symptoms (depression, sleep apnea, anemia, vitamin D deficiency). Use synthetic liothyronine (T3) 5-10 mcg daily, reduce levothyroxine dose by 50 mcg. Monitor TSH and free T3. Reassess symptoms after 3-6 months. Discontinue if no improvement. PATIENT EDUCATION: Levothyroxine is lifelong therapy for most patients. Take medication consistently at same time daily, on empty stomach. Avoid taking with food, calcium, iron, or other medications. Report symptoms of overtreatment (palpitations, tremor, weight loss, insomnia) or undertreatment (fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance). Adherence is critical - missed doses lead to TSH fluctuations. Inform healthcare providers of levothyroxine use before starting new medications. Pregnancy requires dose adjustment - notify provider immediately if pregnant.',

    clinicalImplementation: 'Implementation of Endocrine Society hyperthyroidism guidelines requires systematic approach to diagnosis, treatment selection, and monitoring. DIAGNOSIS: Clinical presentation: Weight loss despite increased appetite, Heat intolerance, Palpitations, Tremor, Anxiety, Insomnia, Frequent bowel movements, Proximal muscle weakness, Menstrual irregularities. Physical exam: Tachycardia, Atrial fibrillation, Warm moist skin, Tremor, Hyperreflexia, Goiter, Graves ophthalmopathy (proptosis, lid lag, periorbital edema). Laboratory diagnosis: TSH: Suppressed (<0.1 mIU/L) in overt hyperthyroidism. Free T4: Elevated (>1.8 ng/dL). Free T3: Elevated (>4.0 pg/mL) or disproportionately elevated in T3 toxicosis. Subclinical hyperthyroidism: Suppressed TSH with normal free T4 and T3. Etiology: Graves disease (60-80%): Autoimmune disorder with TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies (TSI/TRAb). Diffuse goiter, Graves ophthalmopathy (30%), Pretibial myxedema (rare). Toxic multinodular goiter (15-20%): Multiple autonomously functioning thyroid nodules. More common in elderly, iodine-deficient areas. Toxic adenoma (3-5%): Single autonomously functioning thyroid nodule. Thyroiditis (5-10%): Subacute thyroiditis (painful thyroid, elevated ESR), Painless thyroiditis (postpartum thyroiditis), Drug-induced (amiodarone, lithium, interferon-alpha). Transient hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism. Exogenous thyroid hormone: Factitious thyrotoxicosis (intentional or unintentional excess levothyroxine). Low thyroglobulin distinguishes from endogenous hyperthyroidism. Diagnostic tests: TSI or TRAb: Positive in Graves disease (95% sensitivity). Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) scan: High uptake (>30%): Graves disease, toxic nodular goiter. Low uptake (<5%): Thyroiditis, exogenous thyroid hormone. Diffuse uptake: Graves disease. Focal uptake: Toxic nodular goiter or adenoma. Thyroid ultrasound: Assess nodules, goiter size. Doppler: Increased vascularity in Graves disease. TREATMENT OPTIONS: Three definitive treatment options: Antithyroid drugs, Radioactive iodine ablation, Thyroidectomy. Selection based on: Patient preference, Disease severity, Goiter size, Presence of ophthalmopathy, Pregnancy status, Comorbidities. ANTITHYROID DRUGS: Mechanism: Inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis by blocking thyroid peroxidase. Methimazole (MMI): Preferred antithyroid drug. Longer half-life (6-8 hours) allows once-daily dosing. Lower risk of hepatotoxicity than PTU. Dosing: 10-40 mg daily (mild-moderate hyperthyroidism), 40-60 mg daily (severe hyperthyroidism). Propylthiouracil (PTU): Reserved for first trimester pregnancy, thyroid storm, or MMI allergy. Shorter half-life (1-2 hours) requires TID dosing. Higher risk of hepatotoxicity (black box warning). Dosing: 100-200 mg TID. Treatment duration: 12-18 months for Graves disease. Remission rate: 40-50% after 12-18 months. Higher remission if small goiter, mild hyperthyroidism, negative or low TSI. Monitoring: Check TSH, free T4 every 4-6 weeks initially. Once euthyroid, check every 2-3 months. CBC and LFTs at baseline and if symptoms develop. Side effects: Minor: Rash, pruritus, arthralgias, GI upset (5-10%). Treat with antihistamines or switch drugs. Major: Agranulocytosis (0.2-0.5%): Presents with fever, sore throat, infection. Check CBC immediately. Discontinue drug, give antibiotics, consider G-CSF. Hepatotoxicity: PTU > MMI. Presents with jaundice, elevated transaminases. Discontinue drug immediately. Vasculitis (rare): ANCA-positive vasculitis with PTU. Patient education: Report fever, sore throat, jaundice immediately. Avoid pregnancy during treatment (teratogenic). RADIOACTIVE IODINE (RAI): Mechanism: I-131 destroys thyroid tissue via beta radiation. Indications: Definitive treatment for Graves disease, Toxic nodular goiter, Recurrent hyperthyroidism after antithyroid drugs. Contraindications: Pregnancy (absolute), Breastfeeding (absolute), Moderate-to-severe Graves ophthalmopathy (relative - give glucocorticoids if RAI used), Large goiter with compressive symptoms (relative). Dosing: Fixed dose: 10-15 mCi for Graves disease. Calculated dose: Based on gland size and RAIU. Efficacy: 80-90% cure rate with single dose. 10-20% require second dose. Hypothyroidism: Develops in 80-90% within first year. Lifelong levothyroxine replacement required. Monitoring: Check TSH, free T4 every 4-6 weeks until hypothyroid. Start levothyroxine when TSH elevated. Side effects: Radiation thyroiditis (1-2 weeks post-RAI): Transient neck pain, worsening hyperthyroidism. Treat with NSAIDs, beta-blockers. Worsening ophthalmopathy (15-20%): Prevented with glucocorticoids (prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks, then taper). Sialadenitis (rare): Salivary gland inflammation. Treat with hydration, sialagogues. Pregnancy: Avoid pregnancy for 6 months after RAI. THYROIDECTOMY: Indications: Large goiter (>80 g), Compressive symptoms (dysphagia, dyspnea), Contraindications to antithyroid drugs and RAI, Patient preference, Suspicious thyroid nodule, Pregnancy (second trimester if antithyroid drugs fail). Procedure: Total or near-total thyroidectomy. Preoperative preparation: Achieve euthyroid state with antithyroid drugs (4-6 weeks). Add iodine (Lugol solution or potassium iodide) 7-10 days before surgery to reduce vascularity. Alternative: Beta-blockers alone if antithyroid drugs contraindicated. Efficacy: >95% cure rate. Hypothyroidism: 100% require lifelong levothyroxine. Complications: Hypocalcemia (transient 10-30%, permanent 1-2%): Due to hypoparathyroidism. Monitor calcium, give calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (1-2%): Hoarseness, vocal cord paralysis. Bleeding, infection (rare). BETA-BLOCKERS: Provide symptomatic relief: Reduce tachycardia, palpitations, tremor, anxiety. Do NOT treat underlying hyperthyroidism. Options: Propranolol 10-40 mg TID-QID (also blocks T4 to T3 conversion), Atenolol 25-100 mg daily, Metoprolol 25-50 mg BID. Contraindications: Asthma, severe COPD, heart block, decompensated heart failure. SUBCLINICAL HYPERTHYROIDISM: Definition: Suppressed TSH (<0.1 mIU/L) with normal free T4 and T3. Prevalence: 1-2% of general population. Causes: Exogenous levothyroxine (overreplacement), Graves disease, Toxic nodular goiter. Risks: Atrial fibrillation (3-fold increased risk if TSH <0.1 mIU/L), Osteoporosis and fractures (postmenopausal women), Cardiovascular mortality (controversial). Treatment indications: Age >65 years, Osteoporosis or high fracture risk, Cardiac disease (atrial fibrillation, heart failure, coronary artery disease), Symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Treatment approach: If exogenous levothyroxine: Reduce dose. If endogenous: Treat with antithyroid drugs or RAI. Observation: TSH 0.1-0.5 mIU/L, age <65, asymptomatic, no cardiac or bone disease. Recheck TSH every 6-12 months. GRAVES OPHTHALMOPATHY: Autoimmune inflammation of orbital tissues. Occurs in 25-50% of Graves disease patients. Clinical features: Proptosis (bulging eyes), Lid retraction and lag, Periorbital edema, Diplopia (extraocular muscle involvement), Vision loss (optic nerve compression - rare but serious). Severity: Mild: Minimal symptoms, no diplopia or vision loss. Moderate-to-severe: Significant proptosis, diplopia, or soft tissue involvement. Sight-threatening: Optic neuropathy, corneal ulceration. Risk factors: Smoking (strongest risk factor), Radioactive iodine (transient worsening), Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Management: Smoking cessation (essential). Selenium supplementation: 100 mcg BID for 6 months (mild ophthalmopathy). Glucocorticoids: IV methylprednisolone for moderate-to-severe ophthalmopathy. Orbital decompression surgery: For sight-threatening ophthalmopathy or severe proptosis. Orbital radiotherapy: Adjunct to glucocorticoids. Avoid RAI: Use antithyroid drugs or thyroidectomy instead. If RAI necessary, give prophylactic glucocorticoids. THYROID STORM: Rare, life-threatening complication of severe hyperthyroidism. Mortality: 10-30% even with treatment. Precipitants: Infection, Surgery, Trauma, Diabetic ketoacidosis, Iodine exposure, Medication non-adherence. Clinical features: Fever (>38.5°C), Tachycardia (>140 bpm), Atrial fibrillation, Altered mental status (agitation, delirium, coma), GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice), Heart failure. Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis (no specific test). Burch-Wartofsky score ≥45 suggests thyroid storm. Treatment: ICU admission. Antithyroid drugs: PTU 500-1000 mg loading dose, then 250 mg every 4 hours (preferred in thyroid storm due to T4 to T3 conversion blockade), OR Methimazole 60-80 mg loading dose, then 20 mg every 4-6 hours. Iodine: Give 1 hour AFTER antithyroid drug to prevent iodine-induced hormone synthesis. Lugol solution 10 drops TID or potassium iodide 5 drops TID. Beta-blockers: Propranolol 40-80 mg every 4-6 hours (also blocks T4 to T3 conversion), OR Esmolol IV infusion if unable to take oral. Glucocorticoids: Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV every 8 hours or dexamethasone 2 mg IV every 6 hours. Blocks T4 to T3 conversion, treats possible adrenal insufficiency. Supportive care: Cooling blankets for fever (avoid aspirin - displaces thyroid hormone from binding proteins), IV fluids, Treat precipitating cause (antibiotics for infection). Plasmapheresis or dialysis: For refractory cases.',

If TSH suppressed: Suggests autonomously functioning nodule (hot nodule). Perform radioactive iodine uptake scan. Hot nodules rarely malignant (<1%). If TSH normal or elevated: Proceed with ultrasound risk stratification and FNA if indicated. ULTRASOUND RISK STRATIFICATION: High-risk features (malignancy risk 70-90%): Hypoechoic solid nodule, Irregular margins, Microcalcifications, Taller-than-wide shape, Extrathyroidal extension, Suspicious lymph nodes. FNA indicated if ≥1 cm. Intermediate-risk features (malignancy risk 10-20%): Hypoechoic solid nodule without other high-risk features, Isoechoic solid nodule with eccentric calcifications. FNA indicated if ≥1.5 cm. Low-risk features (malignancy risk <5%): Isoechoic or hyperechoic solid nodule, Partially cystic nodule with eccentric solid component, Spongiform nodule (>50% cystic). FNA indicated if ≥2 cm or if clinical concern. Very low-risk features (malignancy risk <1%): Pure cyst, Spongiform nodule. FNA generally not indicated. Observation with repeat ultrasound in 12-24 months. FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION (FNA): Indications: Nodules ≥1 cm with high-risk ultrasound features, Nodules ≥1.5 cm with intermediate-risk features, Nodules ≥2 cm with low-risk features, Any size nodule with suspicious lymph nodes or clinical concern. Technique: Ultrasound-guided FNA (preferred over palpation-guided). 25-27 gauge needle, 2-4 passes. On-site cytology evaluation improves adequacy. Bethesda Classification System: Bethesda I (Nondiagnostic): 1-4% malignancy risk. Repeat FNA with ultrasound guidance. Bethesda II (Benign): <3% malignancy risk. Observation with repeat ultrasound in 12-24 months. Bethesda III (Atypia of Undetermined Significance/Follicular Lesion of Undetermined Significance): 10-30% malignancy risk. Options: Repeat FNA, Molecular testing (BRAF, RAS, RET/PTC), Thyroid lobectomy. Bethesda IV (Follicular Neoplasm/Suspicious for Follicular Neoplasm): 25-40% malignancy risk. Options: Molecular testing, Thyroid lobectomy (diagnostic surgery). Bethesda V (Suspicious for Malignancy): 50-75% malignancy risk. Thyroid lobectomy or total thyroidectomy. Bethesda VI (Malignant): 97-99% malignancy risk. Total thyroidectomy (or lobectomy for low-risk papillary cancer <4 cm). MOLECULAR TESTING: Indications: Indeterminate cytology (Bethesda III-IV) to guide surgical decision-making. Tests: BRAF V600E mutation: Specific for papillary thyroid cancer (99% specificity). Positive BRAF → proceed with surgery. RAS mutations: Associated with follicular adenoma or follicular thyroid cancer. RET/PTC rearrangements: Associated with papillary thyroid cancer. Multi-gene panels: Afirma Gene Expression Classifier, ThyroSeq, ThyGenX/ThyraMIR. High negative predictive value (>95%) - can avoid surgery if negative. Limitations: Cost, Not 100% sensitive or specific, Does not replace clinical judgment. MANAGEMENT OF BENIGN NODULES: Observation: Repeat ultrasound in 12-24 months. If stable, extend interval to 2-5 years. If growth (>20% increase in 2 dimensions or >50% volume increase): Repeat FNA. Levothyroxine suppression therapy: NOT recommended (no proven benefit, risk of hyperthyroidism). Radioactive iodine: For autonomously functioning nodules causing hyperthyroidism. Surgery: For large nodules causing compressive symptoms (dysphagia, dyspnea), Cosmetic concerns, Patient preference. DIFFERENTIATED THYROID CANCER STAGING: TNM staging (AJCC 8th edition): T1: ≤2 cm, limited to thyroid. T2: >2-4 cm, limited to thyroid. T3: >4 cm or minimal extrathyroidal extension. T4: Extensive extrathyroidal extension or invasion of major structures. N0: No lymph node metastases. N1: Lymph node metastases. M0: No distant metastases. M1: Distant metastases (lung, bone, brain). Risk stratification: Low-risk: T1-2, N0, M0, no aggressive histology, no vascular invasion. Intermediate-risk: T3, N0, M0 OR any T, N1 (microscopic), M0 OR aggressive histology or vascular invasion. High-risk: T4 OR any T, N1 (macroscopic), M0 OR any T, any N, M1. SURGICAL MANAGEMENT: Thyroid lobectomy: Indications: Low-risk papillary thyroid cancer 1-4 cm, No extrathyroidal extension, No lymph node metastases, No prior radiation, No family history of thyroid cancer. Advantages: Lower risk of hypoparathyroidism and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, No need for lifelong levothyroxine (50% of patients). Total thyroidectomy: Indications: Tumor >4 cm, Extrathyroidal extension, Lymph node metastases, Distant metastases, Bilateral nodules, Prior head/neck radiation, Family history of thyroid cancer. Advantages: Allows radioactive iodine ablation, Facilitates thyroglobulin monitoring. Lymph node dissection: Central neck dissection: For clinically evident central neck lymph nodes (level VI). Prophylactic central neck dissection controversial (not routinely recommended). Lateral neck dissection: For clinically evident lateral neck lymph nodes (levels II-V). Complications: Hypocalcemia (transient 10-30%, permanent 1-2%), Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (1-2%), Bleeding, infection. RADIOACTIVE IODINE ABLATION: Indications: High-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (T3-4, N1, M1), Intermediate-risk cancer (selective use), Facilitate thyroglobulin monitoring. NOT indicated: Low-risk cancer <1 cm (papillary microcarcinoma). Preparation: Thyroid hormone withdrawal: Stop levothyroxine 4 weeks before RAI (TSH >30 mIU/L required). OR Recombinant human TSH (Thyrogen): 0.9 mg IM daily for 2 days before RAI. Avoids hypothyroidism symptoms. Low-iodine diet: 1-2 weeks before RAI to increase iodine avidity. Dosing: Low-risk remnant ablation: 30-100 mCi. High-risk treatment: 100-200 mCi. Post-therapy whole body scan: 3-7 days after RAI to assess uptake and detect metastases. Side effects: Radiation thyroiditis, Sialadenitis, Nausea, Bone marrow suppression (high doses), Secondary malignancies (rare, dose-dependent). TSH SUPPRESSION THERAPY: Rationale: TSH stimulates thyroid cancer growth. Suppressing TSH reduces recurrence risk. Target TSH: High-risk cancer: <0.1 mIU/L. Intermediate-risk cancer: 0.1-0.5 mIU/L. Low-risk cancer: 0.5-2.0 mIU/L (after 5 years if no recurrence). Levothyroxine dosing: Higher doses than hypothyroidism replacement (1.8-2.2 mcg/kg/day). Monitor TSH every 6-12 months, adjust dose to maintain target. Risks of overtreatment: Atrial fibrillation, Osteoporosis, Hyperthyroidism symptoms. Balance suppression benefit with risks, especially in elderly. SURVEILLANCE: Thyroglobulin (Tg): Tumor marker for differentiated thyroid cancer. Measure every 6-12 months. Undetectable Tg (<0.2 ng/mL) with negative anti-Tg antibodies indicates excellent response. Rising Tg suggests recurrence. Stimulated Tg: Measure after thyroid hormone withdrawal or recombinant TSH. More sensitive than suppressed Tg. Thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb): Interfere with Tg assay. Measure with every Tg. Declining TgAb suggests good response. Neck ultrasound: Every 6-12 months for first 5 years, then annually. Assess for recurrence in thyroid bed or lymph nodes. Diagnostic whole body scan: NOT routinely recommended (low sensitivity, radiation exposure). Consider if rising Tg with negative ultrasound. PET-CT: For Tg-positive, RAI-negative recurrence. Response to therapy assessment: Excellent response: Undetectable Tg, negative imaging. Low recurrence risk (<1%). Continue TSH suppression, less frequent monitoring. Biochemical incomplete response: Detectable Tg, negative imaging. Intermediate recurrence risk. Continue TSH suppression, close monitoring. Structural incomplete response: Structural disease on imaging. High recurrence risk. Consider additional surgery, RAI, or external beam radiation. RECURRENT/METASTATIC DISEASE: Locoregional recurrence: Surgery (neck dissection) if resectable. RAI if iodine-avid. External beam radiation if not resectable or RAI-refractory. Distant metastases: RAI if iodine-avid (lung metastases respond better than bone). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, lenvatinib) for RAI-refractory progressive disease. External beam radiation for symptomatic bone metastases. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS: Papillary microcarcinoma (<1 cm): Excellent prognosis (>99% survival). Active surveillance: Alternative to immediate surgery for low-risk microcarcinoma. Ultrasound every 6-12 months. Surgery if growth or lymph node metastases. Pregnancy: Defer surgery until after delivery if low-risk cancer. Surgery in second trimester if high-risk features or rapid growth. Avoid RAI during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Medullary thyroid cancer: Arises from parafollicular C cells. Secrete calcitonin (tumor marker). Sporadic (75%) or familial (25% - MEN2A, MEN2B, familial MTC). Genetic testing for RET proto-oncogene mutations. Treatment: Total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection. RAI not effective (C cells do not take up iodine). Anaplastic thyroid cancer: Rare, aggressive, poor prognosis. Rapidly growing neck mass, compressive symptoms. Treatment: Multimodal (surgery, external beam radiation, chemotherapy). BRAF inhibitors (dabrafenib + trametinib) for BRAF-mutated anaplastic cancer.',

    guidelineSummary: 'The Endocrine Society guideline for Cushing syndrome provides evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and management of endogenous hypercortisolism. Cushing syndrome results from chronic exposure to excess cortisol. The guideline emphasizes initial screening with 24-hour urinary free cortisol, late-night salivary cortisol, or overnight dexamethasone suppression test. Confirmation requires at least two abnormal tests. Once confirmed, measure ACTH to differentiate ACTH-dependent (pituitary or ectopic) from ACTH-independent (adrenal) causes. Pituitary MRI and inferior petrosal sinus sampling help localize source. Treatment includes transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas, adrenalectomy for adrenal tumors, and medical therapy for persistent disease.',

    qualityOfEvidence: 'Multiple levels: Strong recommendations are based on High to Moderate quality evidence from observational studies; Weak recommendations are based on Moderate to Low quality evidence',
    clinicalImplementation: 'Implementation of Endocrine Society Cushing syndrome guidelines requires systematic approach to screening, diagnosis, and treatment. CLINICAL FEATURES: Classic features: Central obesity with thin extremities, Moon facies, Supraclavicular and dorsocervical fat pads (buffalo hump), Wide purple striae (>1 cm), Easy bruising, Proximal muscle weakness, Osteoporosis and fractures. Additional features: Hypertension, Glucose intolerance or diabetes, Hypokalemia, Menstrual irregularities, Hirsutism and acne, Depression and cognitive dysfunction, Increased infections. Unusual features for age: Osteoporosis in young adults, Hypertension in children, Severe obesity with growth deceleration in children. SCREENING: Who to screen: Patients with multiple progressive features of Cushing syndrome, Unusual features for age (osteoporosis <40 years, hypertension in children), Adrenal incidentaloma with features of hypercortisolism, Children with obesity and growth deceleration. Do NOT screen: Obesity, diabetes, or hypertension alone without other features, Simple obesity without specific Cushingoid features. Screening tests (choose one): 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC): Collect at least 2 measurements. Normal: <50 mcg/24 hours (varies by assay). Elevated: >3× upper limit of normal highly suggestive. Limitations: False positives with high fluid intake, renal disease, depression, alcoholism. Late-night salivary cortisol: Collect at least 2 measurements (11 PM-midnight). Normal: <0.15 mcg/dL (varies by assay). Elevated: >0.15 mcg/dL suggests Cushing syndrome. Advantages: Non-invasive, reflects free cortisol, preserves circadian rhythm assessment. 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST): Give 1 mg dexamethasone PO at 11 PM. Measure serum cortisol at 8 AM next morning. Normal: Cortisol <1.8 mcg/dL (suppression). Abnormal: Cortisol >1.8 mcg/dL (lack of suppression). Limitations: False positives with medications increasing dexamethasone metabolism (phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepine), estrogen therapy, renal failure, depression. CONFIRMATION: Requires at least 2 abnormal screening tests. If only 1 test abnormal: Repeat same test or perform different screening test. Consider pseudo-Cushing states: Depression, Alcoholism, Obesity, Polycystic ovary syndrome. These conditions can cause mild hypercortisolism but lack progressive features. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Measure plasma ACTH: ACTH-dependent (ACTH ≥20 pg/mL): Cushing disease (pituitary adenoma) - 70% of cases, Ectopic ACTH secretion (lung carcinoid, small cell lung cancer, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor) - 10% of cases. ACTH-independent (ACTH <5 pg/mL): Adrenal adenoma - 15% of cases, Adrenal carcinoma - 5% of cases, Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (rare). LOCALIZATION OF ACTH SOURCE: Pituitary MRI: First-line imaging for ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome. Detects pituitary adenoma in 50-60% of cases. Limitations: 40% of microadenomas not visible on MRI, 10% of normal population have incidental pituitary lesions. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS): Gold standard to differentiate pituitary from ectopic ACTH. Indications: Negative or equivocal pituitary MRI, Discordant biochemical and imaging findings. Procedure: Simultaneous sampling from inferior petrosal sinuses (drain pituitary) and peripheral vein. Give CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) during procedure. Interpretation: Central-to-peripheral ACTH ratio: Baseline >2 or post-CRH >3 indicates pituitary source. Lateralization: Interpetrosal gradient >1.4 suggests side of adenoma. High-dose dexamethasone suppression test: Give 8 mg dexamethasone PO at 11 PM, measure cortisol at 8 AM. Suppression >50% suggests pituitary source. Less suppression suggests ectopic source. Limitations: Not as accurate as IPSS. CRH stimulation test: Give CRH IV, measure ACTH and cortisol response. Exaggerated response suggests pituitary source. Blunted response suggests ectopic source. Limitations: Not as accurate as IPSS. Imaging for ectopic ACTH: Chest CT: Detect lung carcinoid, small cell lung cancer. Abdominal CT: Detect pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Octreotide scan: Detect neuroendocrine tumors expressing somatostatin receptors. PET-CT: Detect occult ectopic source. ADRENAL IMAGING: CT or MRI abdomen: Identify adrenal adenoma, carcinoma, or bilateral hyperplasia. Adenoma: <4 cm, homogeneous, low attenuation (<10 HU on unenhanced CT). Carcinoma: >4 cm, heterogeneous, irregular margins, invasion, metastases. Bilateral hyperplasia: Bilateral adrenal enlargement. TREATMENT: Cushing disease (pituitary adenoma): Transsphenoidal surgery: First-line treatment. Remission rate: 70-90% for microadenomas, 50-65% for macroadenomas. Complications: Hypopituitarism (10-20%), diabetes insipidus (transient 20%, permanent 2%), CSF leak, meningitis. Criteria for remission: Postoperative morning cortisol <5 mcg/dL (indicates adrenal suppression from chronic hypercortisolism). Requires glucocorticoid replacement until HPA axis recovers (6-18 months). Persistent or recurrent disease: Repeat surgery (remission rate 50-70%). Pituitary radiation therapy: Stereotactic radiosurgery or conventional radiation. Remission rate: 50-60% over 2-5 years. Complications: Hypopituitarism (50-80%), visual defects, secondary tumors (rare). Medical therapy: Ketoconazole, metyrapone, mifepristone (see below). Bilateral adrenalectomy: Last resort for severe, refractory disease. Requires lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. Risk of Nelson syndrome (pituitary tumor growth after adrenalectomy) - 20-30%. Adrenal adenoma or carcinoma: Unilateral adrenalectomy: Curative for adenoma. Laparoscopic approach for adenoma <6 cm. Open approach for carcinoma or large tumors. Postoperative: Glucocorticoid replacement until contralateral adrenal recovers (6-18 months). Adrenal carcinoma: Often advanced at diagnosis (50% have metastases). Adjuvant mitotane (adrenolytic agent) after surgery. Chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Poor prognosis: 5-year survival 30-50%. Ectopic ACTH syndrome: Surgical resection of ectopic source if localized. Medical therapy to control hypercortisolism if unresectable. Bilateral adrenalectomy if medical therapy fails. MEDICAL THERAPY: Indications: Persistent hypercortisolism after surgery, Preoperative preparation for severe Cushing syndrome, Not surgical candidate, Ectopic ACTH syndrome (unresectable). Steroidogenesis inhibitors: Ketoconazole: 200-400 mg BID-TID. Blocks cortisol synthesis. Side effects: Hepatotoxicity (monitor LFTs), GI upset, gynecomastia. Metyrapone: 250-500 mg TID-QID. Blocks 11β-hydroxylase. Side effects: Hirsutism (increased androgens), hypertension, hypokalemia. Etomidate: IV infusion for severe, acute hypercortisolism (ICU setting). Mitotane: Adrenolytic agent. Used for adrenal carcinoma. Slow onset (weeks to months). Side effects: GI upset, hepatotoxicity, adrenal insufficiency. Glucocorticoid receptor antagonist: Mifepristone: 300-1200 mg daily. Blocks cortisol action at receptor level. Indications: Cushing syndrome with diabetes or glucose intolerance. Side effects: Hypokalemia, endometrial thickening, adrenal insufficiency (cannot monitor cortisol - receptor blocked). Pituitary-directed agents: Pasireotide: Somatostatin analog. 600-900 mcg SC BID. Suppresses ACTH secretion. Modest efficacy (25-35% remission). Side effects: Hyperglycemia (60%), GI upset, gallstones. Cabergoline: Dopamine agonist. 1-3 mg weekly. Modest efficacy (25-40% remission). Side effects: Nausea, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac valvulopathy (rare at low doses). PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: Preoperative: Control severe hypercortisolism with medical therapy (ketoconazole, metyrapone) for 4-8 weeks. Optimize comorbidities: Hypertension, diabetes, hypokalemia, infections. Postoperative glucocorticoid replacement: All patients require glucocorticoid replacement after successful surgery (adrenal suppression). Hydrocortisone 10-20 mg AM, 5-10 mg PM. Taper gradually over 6-18 months as HPA axis recovers. Monitor morning cortisol off hydrocortisone for 24 hours to assess recovery. HPA axis recovered when morning cortisol >10 mcg/dL. MONITORING: Postoperative: Morning cortisol day 1-2 after surgery: <5 mcg/dL indicates remission. 24-hour UFC at 3, 6, 12 months, then annually. Pituitary MRI at 3 months, then annually for 10 years (detect recurrence). Long-term: Annual screening for recurrence (24-hour UFC or late-night salivary cortisol). Recurrence rate: 10-20% over 10 years. Assess for hypopituitarism (TSH, free T4, IGF-1, testosterone/estradiol, morning cortisol). Bone density scan (osteoporosis common). Cardiovascular risk assessment (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia). COMPLICATIONS: Untreated Cushing syndrome: Increased mortality (4-fold higher than general population). Cardiovascular disease (hypertension, heart failure, stroke), Infections (opportunistic infections due to immunosuppression), Thromboembolism, Osteoporosis and fractures, Psychiatric disorders (depression, psychosis). Post-treatment: Adrenal insufficiency (requires glucocorticoid replacement), Hypopituitarism (requires hormone replacement), Nelson syndrome (after bilateral adrenalectomy), Recurrence (10-20% over 10 years).',

    guidelineSummary: 'The Endocrine Society guideline for primary aldosteronism provides evidence-based recommendations for screening, diagnosis, and management of autonomous aldosterone secretion. Primary aldosteronism is the most common cause of secondary hypertension (5-10% of hypertensive patients). The guideline recommends screening high-risk patients with aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR). Confirmatory testing with saline infusion test or oral sodium loading is required. Adrenal CT distinguishes unilateral from bilateral disease. Adrenal venous sampling is gold standard for lateralization. Treatment includes unilateral adrenalectomy for aldosterone-producing adenoma and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone) for bilateral hyperplasia.',

    qualityOfEvidence: 'Multiple levels: Strong recommendations are based on High to Moderate quality evidence from observational studies; Weak recommendations are based on Moderate to Low quality evidence',
    clinicalImplementation: 'Implementation of Endocrine Society primary aldosteronism guidelines requires systematic approach to screening, diagnosis, and treatment. EPIDEMIOLOGY: Prevalence: 5-10% of all hypertensive patients, 20% of patients with resistant hypertension. Most common cause of secondary hypertension. Causes: Aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) - 35% of cases, Bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) - 60% of cases, Unilateral adrenal hyperplasia - 2% of cases, Aldosterone-producing adrenal carcinoma - <1% of cases, Familial hyperaldosteronism (FH-I, FH-II, FH-III, FH-IV) - <1% of cases. CLINICAL FEATURES: Hypertension: Often severe and resistant to treatment. Hypokalemia: Present in 30-50% of cases (not required for diagnosis). Symptoms: Muscle weakness, cramps, paresthesias, polyuria, polydipsia. Metabolic alkalosis: Due to renal potassium and hydrogen ion loss. Cardiovascular complications: Left ventricular hypertrophy, Atrial fibrillation, Stroke, Myocardial infarction. Higher risk than essential hypertension with same blood pressure. SCREENING: Who to screen: Sustained blood pressure >150/100 mmHg on 3 separate occasions, Resistant hypertension (uncontrolled on 3 drugs including diuretic), Hypertension with spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia, Hypertension with adrenal incidentaloma, Hypertension with family history of early-onset hypertension or CVA at young age (<40 years), Hypertension with first-degree relative with primary aldosteronism. Screening test: Aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR). Measure plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA) or direct renin concentration (DRC). ARR = PAC (ng/dL) ÷ PRA (ng/mL/hour). Positive screen: ARR >20-30 (varies by assay) AND PAC >15 ng/dL. Interpretation: High aldosterone + low renin = primary aldosteronism. High aldosterone + high renin = secondary aldosteronism (renovascular hypertension, renin-secreting tumor). Low aldosterone + low renin = low-renin hypertension (common in elderly, African Americans). Medication effects on ARR: Increase ARR (false positives): Beta-blockers (suppress renin), Central alpha-2 agonists (clonidine, methyldopa), NSAIDs (suppress renin). Decrease ARR (false negatives): Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone - must stop 4-6 weeks before testing), Potassium-sparing diuretics (amiloride, triamterene - stop 4 weeks before), Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (increase renin), ACE inhibitors and ARBs (increase renin - stop 2 weeks before if possible), Thiazide and loop diuretics (increase renin - stop 4 weeks before if possible). Preferred antihypertensives during screening: Verapamil (non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker), Hydralazine, Alpha-1 blockers (prazosin, doxazosin, terazosin). Optimal conditions for ARR: Morning sample (8-10 AM), Seated for 5-15 minutes before sampling, Adequate sodium intake (unrestricted diet), Correct hypokalemia (potassium <3.5 mEq/L suppresses aldosterone). CONFIRMATORY TESTING: Required for positive ARR to confirm autonomous aldosterone secretion. Saline infusion test (most commonly used): Infuse 2 L 0.9% saline IV over 4 hours. Measure aldosterone before and after infusion. Positive: Aldosterone >10 ng/dL after infusion (lack of suppression). Negative: Aldosterone <5 ng/dL after infusion (normal suppression). Contraindications: Severe hypertension, heart failure, renal insufficiency, arrhythmias. Oral sodium loading test: High-sodium diet (>200 mEq/day) for 3 days. Collect 24-hour urine on day 3 for aldosterone, sodium, creatinine. Positive: Urine aldosterone >12 mcg/24 hours with urine sodium >200 mEq/24 hours. Fludrocortisone suppression test: Fludrocortisone 0.1 mg every 6 hours for 4 days. Sodium chloride tablets to maintain sodium >200 mEq/day. Measure aldosterone and cortisol on day 4 at 10 AM (upright for 2 hours). Positive: Aldosterone >6 ng/dL with suppressed renin and cortisol <5 mcg/dL. Captopril challenge test: Give captopril 25-50 mg PO. Measure aldosterone and renin at baseline and 1-2 hours after. Positive: Aldosterone remains elevated (>15 ng/dL) and renin suppressed. Less reliable than other tests. SUBTYPE DIFFERENTIATION: Adrenal CT: First-line imaging. Identify unilateral adenoma (>1 cm), bilateral hyperplasia, or normal adrenals. Limitations: Cannot reliably distinguish adenoma from hyperplasia based on imaging alone. 20% of patients >35 years have non-functioning adrenal nodules. Adrenal venous sampling (AVS): Gold standard for lateralization. Indications: All patients being considered for surgery (unless young patient with clear unilateral adenoma and marked biochemical abnormalities). Procedure: Simultaneous catheterization of both adrenal veins and inferior vena cava. Measure aldosterone and cortisol from each site. ACTH stimulation (cosyntropin 250 mcg IV) during procedure to maximize adrenal vein cortisol gradient. Interpretation: Selectivity index: Adrenal vein cortisol ÷ IVC cortisol. >2-3 indicates successful catheterization. Lateralization index: (Aldosterone/cortisol ratio from dominant side) ÷ (Aldosterone/cortisol ratio from non-dominant side). >4 indicates unilateral aldosterone excess. Contralateral suppression: (Aldosterone/cortisol ratio from non-dominant side) ÷ (Aldosterone/cortisol ratio from IVC). <1 indicates suppression of contralateral adrenal. Results: Unilateral aldosterone excess: Aldosterone-producing adenoma or unilateral hyperplasia. Proceed with unilateral adrenalectomy. Bilateral aldosterone excess: Bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism. Treat with medical therapy. Complications: Adrenal hemorrhage (rare), Adrenal vein rupture, Contrast reaction. GENETIC TESTING: Familial hyperaldosteronism (FH): FH-I (glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism): Chimeric CYP11B1/CYP11B2 gene. Aldosterone regulated by ACTH instead of angiotensin II. Treat with low-dose dexamethasone (0.25-0.5 mg daily). Screen first-degree relatives. FH-II: Familial occurrence of APA or IHA. No specific gene identified. FH-III: KCNJ5 mutations. Early-onset, severe hypertension. FH-IV: CACNA1H mutations. Consider genetic testing: Family history of primary aldosteronism, Early-onset hypertension (<20 years), Cerebrovascular accident at young age. TREATMENT: Unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma or unilateral hyperplasia: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy: Curative in 30-60% of patients (complete resolution of hypertension). 50-70% have improved blood pressure control (reduced medication requirements). Preoperative preparation: Spironolactone 25-50 mg daily for 4-6 weeks to control blood pressure and correct hypokalemia. Liberal sodium intake to prevent postoperative hyperkalemia. Postoperative: Monitor potassium (risk of hyperkalemia from suppressed contralateral adrenal). Gradually taper antihypertensive medications. Predictors of cure: Young age (<50 years), Short duration of hypertension (<5 years), Controlled on ≤2 antihypertensive medications preoperatively, No family history of hypertension. Bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism or non-surgical candidates: Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists: Spironolactone: 12.5-25 mg daily initially, titrate to 50-100 mg daily (max 400 mg daily). Side effects: Gynecomastia (50% of men), Erectile dysfunction, Menstrual irregularities, Hyperkalemia. Eplerenone: 25 mg daily initially, titrate to 50-100 mg daily (max 100 mg BID). More selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Fewer sex hormone-related side effects than spironolactone. More expensive. Monitoring: Blood pressure and potassium 4-6 weeks after starting or dose change. Target blood pressure <130/80 mmHg. Target potassium 4.0-5.0 mEq/L. Additional antihypertensive agents: Add if blood pressure not controlled with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist alone. Thiazide diuretics (chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide), Calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, nifedipine), ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if no hyperkalemia). Amiloride: Epithelial sodium channel blocker. 5-10 mg daily (max 20 mg daily). Alternative to spironolactone/eplerenone if contraindicated or not tolerated. Less effective than spironolactone. MONITORING: Postoperative: Blood pressure and potassium at 1, 3, 6, 12 months, then annually. Assess for cure (off all antihypertensives with normal blood pressure) or improvement. Medical therapy: Blood pressure and potassium every 4-6 weeks until stable, then every 3-6 months. Adjust medications to maintain blood pressure <130/80 mmHg and potassium 4.0-5.0 mEq/L. Cardiovascular risk assessment: Screen for left ventricular hypertrophy (echocardiogram), atrial fibrillation (ECG), chronic kidney disease (creatinine, eGFR). COMPLICATIONS: Untreated primary aldosteronism: Cardiovascular disease (stroke, MI, atrial fibrillation) - higher risk than essential hypertension, Left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure, Chronic kidney disease, Metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Treatment complications: Hyperkalemia (especially with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists + ACE inhibitors/ARBs), Gynecomastia and sexual dysfunction (spironolactone), Adrenal insufficiency (rare after unilateral adrenalectomy).',
