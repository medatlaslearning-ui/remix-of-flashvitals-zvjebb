You want a mobile and web app for medical learners, focusing on cardiology initially, with flashcards, quiz mode, admin features, and a clean design. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Flashcard Screen:** Display flashcards with front/back, flip functionality, next/previous navigation, bookmark/favorite buttons.\n*   **Quiz Mode:** Implement a quiz mode with multiple-choice or true/false questions based on the flashcard content.\n*   **Admin Interface (basic):** Create a simple interface (initially within the app) to add, edit, and delete flashcards. This will be expanded later.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#2979FF` (Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#26A69A` (Teal)\n    *   Accent: `#90CAF9` (Light blue)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#E1F5FE` (Very light blue)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default for the platform) or consider loading \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for a more consistent look across platforms.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Data Structure:** Define the data structure for a flashcard (as provided in your example) in a new file, `app/utils/flashcardData.ts`. This will include fields for `system`, `topic`, `front`, `back`, `tags`, `bookmarked`, and `favorite`. Also, create a file `app/constants/Colors.ts` and add the colors specified above.\n2.  **Flashcard Component:** Create a `components/Flashcard.tsx` component to display the flashcard content. This component will handle the flip animation and display the front or back of the card based on user interaction. It will also include the bookmark and favorite buttons.\n3.  **Flashcard Screen:** Create a `app/(tabs)/(home)/FlashcardScreen.tsx` to manage the display of flashcards. This screen will:\n    *   Fetch the initial set of ~20 flashcards (hardcoded for now, from a JSON file in `app/data/cardiology_flashcards.json`).\n    *   Implement the next/previous navigation.\n    *   Implement the flip functionality.\n    *   Implement bookmarking and favoriting (initially only updating the local state).\n4.  **Quiz Mode:** Create a `components/QuizMode.tsx` component. This component will:\n    *   Take an array of flashcards as input.\n    *   Generate multiple-choice or true/false questions based on the flashcard content.\n    *   Track the user's score and provide feedback.\n    *   Implement spaced repetition by re-introducing incorrectly answered questions later in the quiz.\n5.  **Admin Interface:** Create a basic `app/admin/AdminPanel.tsx` screen (accessible via a temporary button on the home screen). This screen will:\n    *   Display a list of flashcards.\n    *   Provide buttons to add, edit, and delete flashcards (initially using simple prompts/alerts for input).\n6.  **Navigation:**\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to include a tab for the FlashcardScreen.\n    *   Add a temporary button on the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to navigate to the `AdminPanel.tsx`.\n\nNow, let's start by creating the data structure and color constants.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-05T10:46:24.278193"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a comprehensive medical learning app for cardiology.
