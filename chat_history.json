You want a mobile and web app for medical learners, focusing on cardiology initially, with flashcards, quiz mode, admin features, and a clean design. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Flashcard Screen:** Display flashcards with front/back, flip functionality, next/previous navigation, bookmark/favorite buttons.\n*   **Quiz Mode:** Implement a quiz mode with multiple-choice or true/false questions based on the flashcard content.\n*   **Admin Interface (basic):** Create a simple interface (initially within the app) to add, edit, and delete flashcards. This will be expanded later.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#2979FF` (Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#26A69A` (Teal)\n    *   Accent: `#90CAF9` (Light blue)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#E1F5FE` (Very light blue)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default for the platform) or consider loading \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for a more consistent look across platforms.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Data Structure:** Define the data structure for a flashcard (as provided in your example) in a new file, `app/utils/flashcardData.ts`. This will include fields for `system`, `topic`, `front`, `back`, `tags`, `bookmarked`, and `favorite`. Also, create a file `app/constants/Colors.ts` and add the colors specified above.\n2.  **Flashcard Component:** Create a `components/Flashcard.tsx` component to display the flashcard content. This component will handle the flip animation and display the front or back of the card based on user interaction. It will also include the bookmark and favorite buttons.\n3.  **Flashcard Screen:** Create a `app/(tabs)/(home)/FlashcardScreen.tsx` to manage the display of flashcards. This screen will:\n    *   Fetch the initial set of ~20 flashcards (hardcoded for now, from a JSON file in `app/data/cardiology_flashcards.json`).\n    *   Implement the next/previous navigation.\n    *   Implement the flip functionality.\n    *   Implement bookmarking and favoriting (initially only updating the local state).\n4.  **Quiz Mode:** Create a `components/QuizMode.tsx` component. This component will:\n    *   Take an array of flashcards as input.\n    *   Generate multiple-choice or true/false questions based on the flashcard content.\n    *   Track the user's score and provide feedback.\n    *   Implement spaced repetition by re-introducing incorrectly answered questions later in the quiz.\n5.  **Admin Interface:** Create a basic `app/admin/AdminPanel.tsx` screen (accessible via a temporary button on the home screen). This screen will:\n    *   Display a list of flashcards.\n    *   Provide buttons to add, edit, and delete flashcards (initially using simple prompts/alerts for input).\n6.  **Navigation:**\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to include a tab for the FlashcardScreen.\n    *   Add a temporary button on the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to navigate to the `AdminPanel.tsx`.\n\nNow, let's start by creating the data structure and color constants.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-05T10:46:24.278193"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a comprehensive medical learning app for cardiology.

This prevents duplicate increments even if the effect runs multiple times.\n\n4. **Reset the reviewed cards tracking** - When flashcards change (new topic or review session), the tracked set is cleared so cards can be counted again in the new session.\n\n### Why This Works:\n\nThe infinite loop was caused by:\n- `incrementReviewCount` updating the flashcards state in the hook\n- This caused `allFlashcards` to change\n- Which triggered the first `useEffect` to run\n- Which updated the local `flashcards` state\n- Which triggered the second `useEffect` to run\n- Which called `incrementReviewCount` again\n- Creating an infinite loop\n\nBy breaking this chain (removing `allFlashcards` and `flashcards` from the dependency arrays and using a ref to track reviewed cards), the loop is prevented while still maintaining the correct functionality."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "3b63094c5f4e1d2efe3516267f6b213ada8e8dca", "message": "fix: Prevent infinite loop in FlashcardsScreen component", "timestamp": "2025-11-05T12:13:30Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/(home)/flashcards.tsx"], "update_number": 4, "parent_commit_id": "7f7c68e69a9fa9ddf388ac23b47d843255cddc49"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-05T12:10:19Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Next button click next question is caught up in bottom where the home and profile buttons are not allowing user to get to next card"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "It appears the \"Next\" button on your flashcard screen is obstructed by the bottom navigation buttons (Home, Profile), preventing users from advancing to the next card.\n\nHere's how we can address this:\n\n1.  **Adjust Button Placement:** Modify the layout of the `FlashcardsScreen` to ensure the \"Next\" button is positioned above the bottom navigation, making it accessible.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-05T12:17:55.420864"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix the issue where the Next button is being obstructed by the bottom navigation.

However, the local `flashcards` state in the `FlashcardsScreen` is only set once when the component mounts (in the `useEffect` that depends on `[topic]`).\n\nThis means:\n1. When you toggle bookmark/favorite, it updates the global flashcards state\n2. But the local `flashcards` array in the screen doesn't get updated\n3. So the `FlashcardComponent` continues to receive the old flashcard data with the unchanged bookmark/favorite values\n\n## The Solution\n\nI need to ensure that the local flashcards state reflects the current state from the hook.

This ensures we always have the latest bookmark/favorite status.\n\n3. **Preserved shuffle order**: The IDs maintain the shuffled order, so the user experience remains the same, but now the data is always fresh from the global state.\n\nThis way, when you toggle a bookmark or favorite:\n- The `toggleBookmark`/`toggleFavorite` functions update the global state in the hook\n- The component re-renders\n- The `flashcards` array is recomputed with the updated data from `allFlashcards`\n- The `FlashcardComponent` receives the updated flashcard with the new bookmark/favorite status\n- The UI updates to show the filled/unfilled icons correctly\n\nThe bookmarks and favorites should now work perfectly for all questions! \ud83c\udf89"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "e47740ebd3f29953e047f0e2b8ec49bedc180349", "message": "fix: Update flashcards from global state to reflect bookmark/fav", "timestamp": "2025-11-06T01:04:13Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/(home)/flashcards.tsx"], "update_number": 11, "parent_commit_id": "1fb45bca92bb4517ae459447543865858e5f8b16"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-06T01:01:56Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Next set of questions need to go into Heart Failure topic.

Updated `hooks/useFlashcards.ts`**\n- Added AsyncStorage integration to persist bookmark and favorite states\n- States are now saved to device storage whenever they change\n- States are loaded from storage when the app starts\n- Added `allFlashcards` to the return object for consistency\n\n**3. Updated `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`**\n- Made the \"Bookmarked\" and \"Favorites\" stat cards clickable\n- Added visual indicators (chevron icons) to show they're interactive\n- Added navigation to filtered views when clicking these cards\n- Cards are disabled when count is 0\n\n**4. Updated `app/(tabs)/(home)/flashcards.tsx`**\n- Added support for `filter` parameter to show bookmarked or favorite cards\n- Dynamic screen title based on filter type\n- Empty state messages specific to each filter type\n- Cards now properly persist their bookmark/favorite status across navigation\n\n### How It Works:\n\n- **Bookmarking/Favoriting**: When you tap the bookmark or heart icon on any card, the state is immediately saved to AsyncStorage\n- **Persistence**: The states persist across app restarts and navigation\n- **Viewing Collections**: \n  - Tap \"Bookmarked\" on the home screen to see all bookmarked cards\n  - Tap \"Favorites\" on the home screen to see all favorite cards\n- **Empty States**: Helpful messages guide users when no cards are bookmarked or favorited yet\n\nThe bookmark and favorite buttons now work correctly and save their state permanently!

If the `allFlashcards` state in `useFlashcards` is not being updated correctly after toggling bookmark/favorite status, the counts will be inaccurate.\n\n3.  **Solution:**\n    *   **Verify State Update:** Double-check the `toggleBookmark` and `toggleFavorite` functions in `useFlashcards.ts`. Ensure that these functions are correctly updating the `flashcards` state using the `setFlashcards` function. The update logic should create a *new* array with the modified card object to trigger a re-render.\n    *   **Check Dependencies:** In `HomeScreen.tsx`, ensure that `bookmarkedCount` and `favoritesCount` `useMemo` hooks have the correct dependencies. They should depend on `allFlashcards` to trigger recalculation whenever the flashcard data changes.\n    *   **Force Refresh (if necessary):** If the state updates seem correct but the UI isn't reflecting the changes, you might need to force a refresh of the `HomeScreen` when it comes into focus. You're already using `useFocusEffect` which is good. Inside the effect, you can update a state variable (like `refreshKey`) to force the `useMemo` hooks to re-evaluate.\n    *   **Inspect AsyncStorage:** Use a debugging tool or logging to inspect the contents of `AsyncStorage` directly. Verify that the `bookmarked` and `favorite` properties are being persisted correctly.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to examine specific parts of the code or generate code snippets to implement these suggestions.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-08T22:15:49.749917"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll investigate the badge count issue by examining the current implementation.

The problem is that the `useFlashcards` hook is correctly updating the state and saving to AsyncStorage, but the `HomeScreen` is using `useMemo` with `refreshKey` as a dependency. However, the `refreshKey` is only updated when the screen comes into focus via `useFocusEffect`. \n\nThe real issue is that when you toggle bookmark/favorite in the `FlashcardsScreen`, the `allFlashcards` array reference in `useFlashcards` IS changing (because we're creating a new array), but the `useMemo` in `HomeScreen` might not be recalculating properly.\n\nLet me trace through the logic more carefully:\n\n1. In `useFlashcards.ts`, when `toggleBookmark` or `toggleFavorite` is called, it updates the `flashcards` state with a new array\n2. The `allFlashcards` returned from the hook is just `flashcards`\n3. In `HomeScreen`, the `useMemo` depends on `allFlashcards` and `refreshKey`\n\nThe issue is likely that the `useMemo` dependencies are correct, but React might not be detecting the change properly. Let me check if there's a more fundamental issue.\n\nActually, I see it now! In the `toggleBookmark` and `toggleFavorite` functions, we're mapping over the array and creating new objects with `{ ...c }` for ALL cards, not just the one being changed. This should work, but let me verify the logic is sound.\n\nWait - I think I found the real issue! Look at the `useMemo` in `HomeScreen`:\n\n```typescript\nconst bookmarkedCount = useMemo(() => {\n  const count = allFlashcards.filter(card => card.bookmarked).length;\n  console.log('HomeScreen: Bookmarked count recalculated:', count);\n  return count;\n}, [allFlashcards, refreshKey]);\n```\n\nThe `refreshKey` dependency is unnecessary and might be causing issues. But more importantly, the `allFlashcards` reference should be changing when the state updates in `useFlashcards`.\n\nLet me check if the issue is that the state update in `useFlashcards` is happening asynchronously and the component isn't re-rendering.

The issue is subtle - the `updateTrigger` is being incremented, and the `useMemo` hooks have it as a dependency. However, I think the real issue might be that React is batching the state updates, and the `updateTrigger` increment might not be triggering a re-render of the memoized values.\n\nLet me try a different approach - instead of relying on `updateTrigger`, let's make sure the `allFlashcards` array reference itself changes, which should automatically trigger the `useMemo` recalculation:\n\nActually, looking at the code again, I realize the issue: the `setUpdateTrigger` is being called AFTER `setFlashcards`, but they're both in the same function. React might be batching these updates. The solution is to ensure that when we update flashcards, we're creating a truly new array reference. Let me verify the current implementation is doing this correctly.\n\nLooking more carefully, I see that in `toggleBookmark` and `toggleFavorite`, we're using `prev.map()` which creates a new array. This should work. But let me add some additional debugging and ensure the state updates are properly propagated:\n\n\n\nPerfect! I've made a crucial change to the `useFlashcards` hook. The issue was that the toggle functions were using the functional update form `setFlashcards(prev => ...)`, but the callbacks had `flashcards` in their dependency array. This could cause stale closure issues.\n\nThe fix I implemented:\n\n1. **Changed from functional updates to direct updates**: Instead of `setFlashcards(prev => ...)`, I now directly use the `flashcards` from the closure and create the updated array from it.\n\n2. **Added `flashcards` to the dependency array**: This ensures the callbacks always have access to the latest flashcards state.\n\n3. **Maintained the same update pattern**: Still creating new arrays and new objects to ensure React detects the changes.\n\n4. **Enhanced logging**: Added more detailed console logs to help track what's happening.\n\nThe key insight is that when using `useCallback` with state dependencies, you need to include those dependencies in the dependency array. The previous code was trying to use functional updates to avoid this, but that can cause issues with the `updateTrigger` not being properly synchronized with the state updates.\n\nNow when you bookmark or favorite a card:\n1. The `flashcards` state will update with a new array\n2. The `updateTrigger` will increment\n3. The `allFlashcards` returned from the hook will be the new array\n4.

If you're still not seeing them, please check the console logs in your browser/device and let me know what messages you see. The logs will help us pinpoint exactly where the issue is."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "484212fcbecf52aabe9089f34d58c5b402e60969", "message": "feat: Add console logging to FlashcardComponent for debugging", "timestamp": "2025-11-14T23:53:18Z", "files_changed": ["data/pulmonaryFlashcards.ts", "components/FlashcardComponent.tsx", "app/(tabs)/(home)/flashcards.tsx"], "update_number": 32, "parent_commit_id": "080d5c2797587f6cda933dd4c01f5f9c14338645"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-14T23:49:34Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Add all flashcards below into the flashcards data structure using these fields:\n\nsystem = \"Pulmonary\"\ntopic = \"Pulmonary Infections\"\ndifficulty = E, M, or D\nfront = question text\nback = definition, high_yield, clinical_pearl\n\nThese flashcards must be saved under:\nPulmonary \u2192 Pulmonary Infections\n\nFormat of each flashcard:\n#|Difficulty|Front|Definition|High-Yield|Clinical Pearl\n\nNow import all flashcards listed below into the Pulmonary Infections subtopic.1|E|Most common cause of CAP?|Streptococcus pneumoniae|Lobar pneumonia|Rust-colored sputum\n2|E|Atypical pneumonia cause?|Mycoplasma pneumoniae|Diffuse infiltrates|Dry cough\n3|E|HAP pathogen?|Pseudomonas, MRSA|Hospital exposure|Broad-spectrum needed\n4|E|Viral pneumonia hallmark?|Diffuse interstitial pattern|Flu, RSV|PCR helps diagnose\n5|E|Typical pneumonia sign?|Fever + productive cough|Consolidation|Dullness to percussion\n6|E|Atypical pneumonia sign?|Low-grade fever|Diffuse crackles|Gradual onset\n7|E|CURB-65 purpose?|Pneumonia severity tool|0\u20131 outpatient|\u22652 consider admission\n8|E|Most common aspiration pneumonia site?|Right lower lobe|Dependent area|Anaerobic bacteria common\n9|E|Legionella clue?|Hyponatremia + GI symptoms|Atypical pneumonia|Contaminated water\n10|E|PCP pneumonia in HIV?|Pneumocystis jirovecii|Ground-glass CT|\u2191LDH\n11|E|Influenza pneumonia sign?|High fever, myalgias|Viral pattern|Risk of bacterial superinfection\n12|E|COVID pneumonia hallmark?|Bilateral ground-glass opacities|Peripheral distribution|Loss of smell\n13|E|TB transmission type?|Airborne droplets|Primary lung infection|Screen high-risk groups\n14|E|Latent TB test?|Positive IGRA/PPD|No symptoms|Needs prophylaxis\n15|E|Active TB symptoms?|Fever, night sweats, cough|Hemoptysis|Weight loss\n16|M|ARDS cause?|Inflammatory lung injury|Non-cardiogenic edema|Refractory hypoxemia\n17|M|ARDS hallmark on X-ray?|Bilateral infiltrates|Diffuse alveolar damage|No cardiac cause\n18|M|HAP treatment start?|Empiric broad-spectrum|Cover MRSA/Pseudomonas|De-escalate with cultures\n19|M|CAP outpatient therapy?|Macrolide or doxycycline|Add \u03b2-lactam if comorbidities|Follow guidelines\n20|M|CAP inpatient therapy?|\u03b2-lactam + macrolide|Or respiratory fluoroquinolone|Based on severity\n21|M|PEP for TB exposure?|INH or rifampin|After ruling out active disease|Prevents reactivation\n22|M|Aspiration pneumonia pathogens?|Anaerobes|Mixed flora|Treat with ampicillin-sulbactam\n23|M|What is empyema?|Pus in pleural space|Complicated pneumonia|Needs drainage\n24|M|Lung abscess cause?|Anaerobic infection|Cavity with air-fluid level|Treat prolonged antibiotics\n25|M|RSV pneumonia clue?|Wheezing + winter season|Infants/elderly|Supportive care\n26|M|Histoplasmosis geography?|Ohio/Mississippi River valleys|Bat/bird droppings|Can mimic TB\n27|M|Blastomycosis geography?|Midwest/South|Skin lesions|Broad-based budding yeast\n28|M|Coccidioidomycosis geography?|Southwest US|Desert soil|Erythema nodosum\n29|M|Aspergillus infection type?|Fungal colonization/invasion|Halo sign on CT|High mortality if invasive\n30|M|Cryptococcus clue?|Immunocompromised|Yeast with capsule|Causes meningitis\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will add the provided flashcards to the `pulmonaryFlashcards.ts` file under the \"Pulmonary Infections\" topic.

`circle.hexagongrid` \u2192 `hexagon`\n  - `circle.grid.cross` \u2192 `grid-view`\n  - `waveform.path.ecg` \u2192 `monitor-heart`\n\n## Result:\n\nNow you have a fully functional \"Endocrine\" button on the home screen that:\n- Shows \"0 cards \u2022 0 topics\" (since there are no flashcards yet)\n- When clicked, navigates to the endocrine-topics screen\n- Displays all 6 subtopics you requested:\n  - Diabetes Mellitus\n  - Thyroid Disorders\n  - Adrenal Disorders\n  - Calcium and Bone Metabolism\n  - Reproductive Endocrinology\n  - Endocrine Tumors\n\nThe button is styled consistently with the other medical system buttons and is ready for you to add flashcards in the future!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "bf01af34c40bed080130c32f2a86e8454d62e7b8", "message": "feat: Add Endocrine system button and data structure to app", "timestamp": "2025-12-03T14:17:52Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "components/IconSymbol.tsx", "data/endocrineFlashcards.ts", "hooks/useFlashcards.ts"], "update_number": 82, "parent_commit_id": "ce334575022cc596f9979ef01df974bb200ee145"}], "timestamp": "2025-12-03T14:15:03Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Add these first 32 flashcards below into the Endocrine system under the subtopic\n\u201cDiabetes Mellitus.\u201d\n\nUse the following fields for each flashcard:\n\nsystem = \"Endocrine\"\ntopic = \"Diabetes Mellitus\"\ndifficulty = E, M, or D\nfront = question text\nback = definition, high_yield, clinical_pearl\n\nThese flashcards must be saved under:\nEndocrine \u2192 Diabetes Mellitus\n\nEach flashcard follows this format:\n#|Difficulty|Front|Definition|High-Yield|Clinical Pearl\n\nNow import all flashcards below into the Diabetes Mellitus subtopic. 1|E|Diagnostic A1c level for diabetes?|A1c \u22656.5%|Standard diagnostic threshold|Confirm on repeat\n2|E|Fasting glucose diagnostic level?|\u2265126 mg/dL|Two separate tests|Part of ADA criteria\n3|E|Random glucose threshold for diabetes?|\u2265200 mg/dL + symptoms|Polyuria, polydipsia|Diagnostic\n4|E|OGTT diagnostic glucose?|\u2265200 mg/dL at 2 hours|Oral glucose tolerance test|Used in pregnancy screening\n5|E|Key feature of T1DM?|Autoimmune \u03b2-cell destruction|Requires insulin|Younger onset\n6|E|Key feature of T2DM?|Insulin resistance|Associated with obesity|Gradual onset\n7|E|Classic T1DM symptoms?|Polyuria + weight loss|Polydipsia|Fatigue\n8|E|Classic T2DM symptoms?|Fatigue + recurrent infections|Obesity common|Often asymptomatic\n9|E|First-line drug for T2DM?|Metformin|Improves insulin sensitivity|GI upset common\n10|E|Metformin contraindication?|Severe renal disease|Risk lactic acidosis|Hold before contrast studies\n11|E|What is DKA?|Ketone buildup from insulin deficiency|Hyperglycemia + acidosis|Common in T1DM\n12|E|What is HHS?|Severe hyperglycemia without ketosis|Very high glucose|Common in T2DM\n13|E|Most important initial treatment for DKA/HHS?|IV fluids|Restore perfusion|Insulin after fluids\n14|E|Insulin therapy for T1DM?|Basal + bolus|Essential lifelong|Mimics physiologic release\n15|E|Hypoglycemia symptoms?|Sweating, tremor|Confusion|Treat with glucose\n16|E|Treat severe hypoglycemia?|Glucagon|IM or intranasal|If IV access unavailable\n17|E|Diabetic neuropathy symptom?|Burning foot pain|Stocking-glove distribution|Common complication\n18|E|Diabetic nephropathy test?|Urine albumin/creatinine ratio|Annual screening|ACEi slows progression\n19|E|Diabetic retinopathy prevention?|Annual dilated exam|Strict glycemic control|Laser therapy helps\n20|E|SGLT2 inhibitor benefit?|Reduces CV mortality|Weight loss|Risk of DKA (euglycemic)\n21|M|GLP-1 agonist benefit?|Weight loss|Cardioprotective|Weekly injections available\n22|M|DKA labs?|High anion gap|Positive ketones|Low bicarbonate\n23|M|HHS hallmark?|Glucose >600 mg/dL|No significant ketones|Severe dehydration\n24|M|DKA potassium status?|Total body K+ depleted|Serum K+ may appear high|Replace during insulin therapy\n25|M|Basal insulin examples?|Glargine, detemir|Long-acting|Once daily\n26|M|Bolus insulin examples?|Lispro, aspart|Rapid-acting|Before meals\n27|M|DPP-4 inhibitor mechanism?|Increases incretin levels|Mild A1c reduction|Well tolerated\n28|M|Thiazolidinedione (TZD) concern?|Edema + weight gain|Heart failure risk|Pioglitazone preferred\n29|M|Sulfonylurea mechanism?|Increase insulin secretion|Risk hypoglycemia|Glipizide safest\n30|M|Screening for diabetes age?|Age 35+ or risk factors|Earlier in obesity|Repeat every 3 yrs\n31|M|A1c target for most adults?|<7%|Individualized|Less strict in elderly\n32|M|Charcot foot cause?|Neuropathy|Bone destruction|Painless deformity\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will add the 32 flashcards you provided to the \"Diabetes Mellitus\" subtopic within the \"Endocrine\" system.
