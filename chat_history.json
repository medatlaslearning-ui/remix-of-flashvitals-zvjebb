You want a mobile and web app for medical learners, focusing on cardiology initially, with flashcards, quiz mode, admin features, and a clean design. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Flashcard Screen:** Display flashcards with front/back, flip functionality, next/previous navigation, bookmark/favorite buttons.\n*   **Quiz Mode:** Implement a quiz mode with multiple-choice or true/false questions based on the flashcard content.\n*   **Admin Interface (basic):** Create a simple interface (initially within the app) to add, edit, and delete flashcards. This will be expanded later.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#2979FF` (Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#26A69A` (Teal)\n    *   Accent: `#90CAF9` (Light blue)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#E1F5FE` (Very light blue)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default for the platform) or consider loading \"Roboto\" or \"Open Sans\" for a more consistent look across platforms.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Data Structure:** Define the data structure for a flashcard (as provided in your example) in a new file, `app/utils/flashcardData.ts`. This will include fields for `system`, `topic`, `front`, `back`, `tags`, `bookmarked`, and `favorite`. Also, create a file `app/constants/Colors.ts` and add the colors specified above.\n2.  **Flashcard Component:** Create a `components/Flashcard.tsx` component to display the flashcard content. This component will handle the flip animation and display the front or back of the card based on user interaction. It will also include the bookmark and favorite buttons.\n3.  **Flashcard Screen:** Create a `app/(tabs)/(home)/FlashcardScreen.tsx` to manage the display of flashcards. This screen will:\n    *   Fetch the initial set of ~20 flashcards (hardcoded for now, from a JSON file in `app/data/cardiology_flashcards.json`).\n    *   Implement the next/previous navigation.\n    *   Implement the flip functionality.\n    *   Implement bookmarking and favoriting (initially only updating the local state).\n4.  **Quiz Mode:** Create a `components/QuizMode.tsx` component. This component will:\n    *   Take an array of flashcards as input.\n    *   Generate multiple-choice or true/false questions based on the flashcard content.\n    *   Track the user's score and provide feedback.\n    *   Implement spaced repetition by re-introducing incorrectly answered questions later in the quiz.\n5.  **Admin Interface:** Create a basic `app/admin/AdminPanel.tsx` screen (accessible via a temporary button on the home screen). This screen will:\n    *   Display a list of flashcards.\n    *   Provide buttons to add, edit, and delete flashcards (initially using simple prompts/alerts for input).\n6.  **Navigation:**\n    *   Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to include a tab for the FlashcardScreen.\n    *   Add a temporary button on the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to navigate to the `AdminPanel.tsx`.\n\nNow, let's start by creating the data structure and color constants.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-05T10:46:24.278193"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a comprehensive medical learning app for cardiology.

Here's what I changed:\n\n### Key Fixes:\n\n1. **Removed `allFlashcards` from the first `useEffect` dependency array** - The first `useEffect` now only depends on `topic`, preventing it from re-running every time the flashcards state updates in the hook.\n\n2. **Removed `flashcards` from the second `useEffect` dependency array** - The second `useEffect` now only depends on `currentIndex`, so it only runs when the user navigates to a different card.\n\n3. **Added a `reviewedCardsRef` to track reviewed cards** - Using a `useRef` with a `Set`, I track which cards have already had their review count incremented in the current session. This prevents duplicate increments even if the effect runs multiple times.\n\n4. **Reset the reviewed cards tracking** - When flashcards change (new topic or review session), the tracked set is cleared so cards can be counted again in the new session.\n\n### Why This Works:\n\nThe infinite loop was caused by:\n- `incrementReviewCount` updating the flashcards state in the hook\n- This caused `allFlashcards` to change\n- Which triggered the first `useEffect` to run\n- Which updated the local `flashcards` state\n- Which triggered the second `useEffect` to run\n- Which called `incrementReviewCount` again\n- Creating an infinite loop\n\nBy breaking this chain (removing `allFlashcards` and `flashcards` from the dependency arrays and using a ref to track reviewed cards), the loop is prevented while still maintaining the correct functionality."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "3b63094c5f4e1d2efe3516267f6b213ada8e8dca", "message": "fix: Prevent infinite loop in FlashcardsScreen component", "timestamp": "2025-11-05T12:13:30Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/(home)/flashcards.tsx"], "update_number": 4, "parent_commit_id": "7f7c68e69a9fa9ddf388ac23b47d843255cddc49"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-05T12:10:19Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Next button click next question is caught up in bottom where the home and profile buttons are not allowing user to get to next card"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "It appears the \"Next\" button on your flashcard screen is obstructed by the bottom navigation buttons (Home, Profile), preventing users from advancing to the next card.\n\nHere's how we can address this:\n\n1.  **Adjust Button Placement:** Modify the layout of the `FlashcardsScreen` to ensure the \"Next\" button is positioned above the bottom navigation, making it accessible.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-05T12:17:55.420864"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix the issue where the Next button is being obstructed by the bottom navigation.

I've successfully added all 15 new flashcards (#36-50) to your Arrhythmias topic. Here's what I added:\n\n**New Flashcards Added (IDs 54-68):**\n\n1. **RBBB** - rsR' pattern in V1-V2, often benign in young adults\n2. **LBBB** - Broad notched R in I, V6; new LBBB with chest pain = possible MI\n3. **Ventricular Escape Rhythm** - 20-40 bpm, indicates failure of higher pacemakers\n4. **Polymorphic VT** - Varying QRS morphology, differentiate from torsades\n5. **Idioventricular Rhythm** - <40 bpm, common post-reperfusion\n6. **AIVR** - 40-100 bpm, seen after MI reperfusion, usually benign\n7. **Ventricular Fibrillation** - Chaotic activity, immediate defibrillation required\n8. **Asystole** - Straight-line ECG, check leads, poor prognosis\n9. **PEA** - ECG activity without pulse, caused by Hs and Ts\n10. **Digoxin Toxicity** - Ectopic atrial tachycardia with AV block, \"scooped\" ST segments\n11. **Right Atrial Enlargement** - Tall peaked P waves (P pulmonale)\n12. **Left Atrial Enlargement** - Broad notched P waves (P mitrale)\n13. **Early Repolarization** - Benign ST elevation variant, differentiate from STEMI\n14. **Atrial Standstill** - No P waves, rare, associated with hyperkalemia\n15. **Hyperkalemia ECG Progression** - Peaked T \u2192 PR prolongation \u2192 wide QRS \u2192 sine wave\n\nAll flashcards follow the same structure with:\n- **Definition** - Core concept explanation\n- **High-yield** - Key facts for quick recall\n- **Clinical pearl** - Practical clinical insights\n\nYour Arrhythmias topic now has **50 comprehensive flashcards** covering everything from basic rhythms to advanced ECG patterns and life-threatening arrhythmias! \ud83c\udf89"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-11-06T00:48:09Z"}]
