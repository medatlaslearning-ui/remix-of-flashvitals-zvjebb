   - Tranexamic acid administration
   - Permissive hypotension
   - Prevention of lethal triad

3. **Traumatic Brain Injury Management**
   - Prevention of secondary brain injury
   - Intracranial pressure monitoring and management

### Quality of Evidence
- **Quality A:** High quality evidence from randomized controlled trials
- **Quality B:** Moderate quality evidence from observational studies
- **Quality C:** Low quality evidence or expert opinion

### Clinical Implementation
- Detailed step-by-step protocols

## 🎯 INTEGRATION HIGHLIGHTS

### ✅ Same Quality as Previous Integrations
- Consistent structure with ASA, IDSA, NCCN, ADA, ACG, NIDDK, KDIGO, SCCM, CHEST, ATS, EACTS, SCAI, HRS, HFSA, ESC, AHA, ACC guidelines
- Comprehensive clinical implementation guidance
- Evidence-based recommendations with quality ratings
- Key points for quick reference

### ✅ Content Bleeding Prevention
- Trauma-specific keywords prevent mixing with other specialties

- Clear distinction from sepsis guidelines (IDSA)
- Clear distinction from cardiac guidelines (ACC/AHA)

### ✅ Keyword Specificity
- ATLS protocol keywords
- Damage control resuscitation keywords
- Trauma-specific terminology
- Prevents false matches with non-trauma content
