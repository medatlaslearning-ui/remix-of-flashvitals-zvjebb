## 🔧 ADVANCED FEATURES

### Focused Queries

Ask specific questions to get focused responses:

**Pathophysiology:**
```
"What is the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic shock?"
```

**Clinical Presentation:**
```
"What are the clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure?"
```

**Diagnosis:**
```
"How do you diagnose tension pneumothorax?"
```

**Treatment:**
```
"What is the treatment for massive hemothorax?"
```

---

### Multiple Guidelines

Compare guidelines from different sources:

```
"Compare ACS trauma guidelines with IDSA sepsis guidelines for shock management"
```

The chatbot will provide both ACS hemorrhagic shock and IDSA septic shock guidelines with clear distinctions.

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Content Separation

The chatbot maintains clear separation between:
- **ACS Trauma Guidelines** (trauma care)
- **ASA Guidelines** (stroke care)
- **IDSA Guidelines** (infectious disease)
- **ACC/AHA Guidelines** (cardiac care)

Each guideline source is clearly labeled and distinguished.
